Making a cooking recipe? That wasn't Sanket enough, so what else do I love, apart from Coding. 
Oh um!! Minecraft :)
So this is a small Minecraft, tutorial, if you would like to call it that.
So Minecraft is one of my favorite games, it is a simple building games, like Lego.
-Lego in your computer-
So I like that game a lot.
So wait a second, let me read line 6 of "Specific Tasks to complete the Project", Create a README.md file to explain what the recipe is.
So in my case, I would tell you what the game is, which I already did, it is a simple building game, you can be, creative, the one thing that brought me into Coding, and..... Minecraft :)
