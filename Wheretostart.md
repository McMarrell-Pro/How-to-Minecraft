In Survival Mode, you can surviva the world of Minecraft, as the most iconic Minecraft Character, Steve. And you need to break trees, collect stones. And build a Shelter, for your first night.
So there are Zombies, Creepers (See Creeper.png :)(Pictures folder)) and Skeletons. 
-Creepers Explode by the way-
You need to build a Shelter, and stay there, you have IQ, as much as, if, Einstein's IQ was multiplied by The Total Number of Words I wrote, from PLSDONTREADME to all the way here, and here, and also here, even this counts. 
So you can build some tools in your inventory, yea the game indeed sound dull, but if you will play it, you will love it.
So then you need to make a crafting table to craft more tools. Make furnace, find Iron, Gold, Coal, and everything else, melt them, craft them. Make tools, cover yourself with Armour  "cadvhbdabc", sorry I wrote that random thing to test if my "Armour" spelling was right, you know I was checking if spell-check works, so I was checking if that thing gets red lines, it means Spell-check works, hence my Armour spelling is correct, aren't I the smartest :)  
-Hey Small note, if you find out that my Armour spelling was wrong, then please don't think I am not the Smartest :(
So where was I? 
Side note: Why did I even write that line because I obviously know what I was writing ;-; 
So after getting tools and Armour cjdkjdbdf, *Ehem* *Ehem* Obviously not Covid 21, so after covering up, you need to get going, and fighting the Mobs, means, Zmobies, Creeper and other things. 
So these were the basics.
