 Hey I just observed how this is above PLSDONTREADME.md, but sorry, please read PLSDONTREADME.md first, then Wheretostart.md, then this one :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
 *Avoid Spoilers please :(

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
     Welcome
I am kind of suspicious that you are seeing this first 0_0
So the main "RECIPE", I might add, is that now you need to kill, Endermen, the RIP-OFF yet more memorable versions of Slendermen, theu can teleport, and will become aggressive chbsbdwbcwd, 
-Btw this time the Spelling is correct :)
-Another lame "Where was I"-
So Endermen become angry when you see them, you both maybe in a public bus, squished together, but the moment you see him, he will kill you ;-;, so after some struggle, hehe, you will get "Ender Pearl", then there is something called, "Nether", another Dimension. There you need to find Forretress, there you can find Blazes (Some Entities, kind of bad, also see Blazes.png), after killing them you get Blaze Rods.
-TBH I added Blazes.png later, because them droppig "RODS" was 404 Undefinable chfwhhkgw, so you can see they indeed have rods-
So after combining the Rods and Ender  Pearl, you can get Eyes of Ender, throw them in the air, they will lead you to a Portal, then you can go into the Portal and fight the Ender Dragon (Ender Dragon.png), and then you can free the World from that Dangerous guy (Fun fact: Ender Dragon is a Girl, but I, being a Minecraft Professional, will call it a guy, and no one will care), so yea that's how you play this game.
Hey Kids, ready for some tit-bits?
*Imagine a guy with a BIG smile, swinging his hand, you know what I am asking for, right
1. I am a Minecraft Professional
2. I am the best
3. I am the bestest ever
4. My Minecraft ID is McMarrell (I always use this :) this is my go-to Username)
5. Minecraft is awesome
6. My favorite Minecraft youtubers are Dream(Dream.png, and also DreamLogo.png)(Logo is his channel logo, Character is how his character looks, man I ellaborate so well I can be a teaches, hehe), Technoblade(Technoblade.png)(Techno being the best he is, has a lot of Characters, based of the events, see Serious Techno in pictures to see his serious Character when he is doing something special or serious, see Simple Techno for when he is light, and for funny events he uses these kind of stupid yet simple character designs), and ummmmmm...... Me myself :) hehe

So again,
Adios
